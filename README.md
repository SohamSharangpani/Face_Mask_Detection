# Face Mask Detection
Scientists have proven that masking lowers COVID-19 cases, even in the long term. As we approach back-to-school season, public knowledge of proper masking technique is now more important than ever.

Our objective is to detect if you are wearing a face mask properly to protect yourself, and the public. For this project, we used images of our family and friends, hence it will remain confidential.
